                Here he is resting after a hike on the Swiss Alps.

Skindness is a small shop located in East Belfafst and we're selling all kinds of natural, cruelty-free skincare products. You can pop in to get your favourite cream or you can order it online on our website.</p>

            <div class="text4">Music is one of my biggest passions. I've been listening to all kinds of rock and metal music since I was a teenager, and I absolutely love seeing my favourite bands live!
                Here's a pic of a Finnish folk metal band playing in Belfast after the Covid restrictions were finally lifted.
